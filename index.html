        Hi, my name is <span class="name">John Hamlin.</span>
      </p>
      <h2>I'm a storyteller turned software developer.</h2>
      <p>
        I know enough JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Git to be dangerous, and I'm
        learning more every day at
        <a href="https://www.momentumlearn.com/">Momentum</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a writer, I built a career translating complex topics into everyday
        language. In government communications, I loved finding ways to engage
        audiences with information that would improve their lives. As a
        newspaper reporter, I covered everything from the Ham & Yam Festival to
        Fortune 500 companies and future presidents.
